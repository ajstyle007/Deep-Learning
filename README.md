Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on training artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to learn and extract patterns from large datasets. It mimics the human brain's ability to process data, recognize patterns, and make decisions.

Deep learning is powered by artificial neural networks (ANNs) that consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers:

1. Input Layer: Takes the raw data (e.g., images, text, audio).
2. Hidden Layers: Perform feature extraction and transformations using nonlinear functions.
3. Output Layer: Produces the final predictions or results.

### Why is Deep Learning Important?
- Automation: Reduces manual feature engineering.
- Complex Problem Solving: Excels at tasks involving images, videos, speech, and natural language.
- Scalability: Performs well with massive amounts of data and computational power (e.g., GPUs, TPUs).

### Applications of Deep Learning:
- Image Recognition: Face detection, medical image analysis.
- Natural Language Processing: Chatbots, text generation, sentiment analysis.
- Speech Recognition: Voice assistants like Siri, Alexa.
- Autonomous Vehicles: Object detection, navigation systems.
- Recommendation Systems: Netflix, YouTube, and e-commerce platforms.

Deep learning forms the backbone of modern artificial intelligence, enabling breakthroughs in fields like computer vision, natural language understanding, and robotics.
